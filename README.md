The game is initialized with frogs that represents the player’s lives. The game objective is to control a frog to navigate through the “traffic” from the bottom of the screen to the top of the screen. 
Screen is divided into 7 arrays. The bottom array and top array is the start and the finish point of the game. Moving rectangles in middle arrays will be the “traffic”. User use KEY[0: 3] to control the frog to move up, down, left and right. A single press of the key will cause the frog to move in corresponding direction by one block. Collide with the moving rectangles will be consider as “losing a life” and frog will be reset to start point. After 3 collisions, game is over.
